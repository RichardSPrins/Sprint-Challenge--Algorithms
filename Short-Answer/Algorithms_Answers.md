#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n)
  function runtime complexity is solely dependent on the lencth or size of 'a'

b)O(n^2)
  two nested loops, so for each iteration in the first loop, there must be n more times of iterations in the nested loop

c)O(n)
  again, solely dependent on the size of 'bunnies' or 'n' and each operation only occurs once per iteration of 'bunnies' elements/value
